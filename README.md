## Ollama Integration (AI Features)

To enable AI-based exam and code generation:

1. Install Ollama from: https://ollama.com/download
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ollama serve
3. In a new terminal tab, run:
   ollama pull mistral
   ollama run mistral (after pulling the model)
   ollama serve (in new tab)
4. Then start the app (StudyTracker.exe)

✅ If Ollama is running, the app will use the Mistral model automatically.
❌ If not, it will use offline generation instead.
